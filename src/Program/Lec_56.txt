    56) Multiple Inheritence in Java :-


 1) Multiple Inheritence is not possible in Java means one class cann't extend more than one class.
 2) Multiple Inheritence faces problems when there exist methods with same signature in both the super class which he extend.
 3) Due to such problem, Java does not support multiple inheritence directly but similar concept can be achieved using Interfaces.
 4) A class can implements multiple Interfaces and extend only one class at the same time.
