1) Package com.company :- This package group these functions and classes

2) public static void main(String[] args){ } :-
        when there is no function in your java program and you want the snippet of a code to be executed so there is a default function inside every java program  whose name is always "main" along with that we write code inside this function, the code we have written here will be executed

Now the function where is there or there are many such functions, they are
basically inside a class
Here the class name is "main" because filename is "Main.java" so class name is "main"

inside this mian class, we created a function with name "public static void main" and we put this inside the package named "com.company"


function => plumber
class => collection of similar function
         there can be many functions inside a class
E.X. :- If you are creating a class inside which you need the function to do
        all the household work
        So we named class as "HouseholdRepair" inside which there can be plumber,carpenter,painter,execute
Object => class is a template through which objects are made
E.X. :- If you have a template "form" in which name,address,phone no. & age
        is written so once you have created an entity by filling that form
        then it become an object of that class.

Note == You have to create the object of class in order to run the program

But in that case, we had not created the function this is possbile because we
have used "static" keyword


void main indicate that function doesn't return any value after calling it.

"main" is thename of the function, when you start a program in the java then
the starting point will be "main" in this class

Note == Your java program starts with main() function

Here public is the acess modifier, public means your method of this class can be accessed from anywhere

static makes it possible for us to run these functions without creating an object of the class
