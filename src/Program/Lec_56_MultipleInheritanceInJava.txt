    56) Multiple Inheritance in Java :-


 1) Multiple Inheritance is not possible in Java means one class can't extend more than one class.
 2) Multiple Inheritance faces problems when there exist methods with same signature in both the super class which he extends.
 3) Due to such problem, Java does not support multiple inheritance directly but similar concept can be achieved using Interfaces.
 4) A class can implements multiple Interfaces and extend only one class at the same time.
