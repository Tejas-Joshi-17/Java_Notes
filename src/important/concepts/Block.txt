1) Static Block :-
        - A static block (also known as a static initializer) is executed once when the class is loaded into memory.
        - It is used to initialize static variables.
        - It runs before the main method and before any instance of the class is created.
        - Multiple static blocks are executed in order of their declaration.

2) Instance Block :-
        - An instance block (also called instance initializer) is executed every time an object is created, before the constructor.
        - It is used to initialize instance variables.
        - If there are multiple instance blocks, they execute in the order of declaration.

3) constructor    :-  Runs when Object Created.
                      Runs Everytime when object Created.
