Abstract Class :-

    1) The abstract class in Java cannot be instantiated (we cannot create objects of abstract class).
    2) We use 'abstract' keyword to declare an abstract class.
    3) An abstract class can have both regular methods(Concrete Method) & Abstract Method.
    4) If a class contains at least one abstract method then class is becoming abstract class.
    5) A method that doesn't have its body is known as an abstract method.
    6) Though abstract classes cannot be instantiated, we can create subclasses from it.
        We can then access members of the abstract class using the object of the subclass.
    7) If the abstract class includes any abstract method, then all the child classes inherited from the abstract superclass must
        provide the implementation of that abstract methods.

Java Abstraction :-

    - Abstraction is an important concept of object-oriented programming that allows us to hide unnecessary details and only shows
      the needed information.
    - This allows us to manage complexity or hiding details with a simpler higher-level idea.
